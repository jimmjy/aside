## Adeptmind frontend test

There are two parts in the Adeptmind frontend test. The first part is to style a profile page and the second is to answer one of two javascript questions.

## Part 1

### Profile Styling

The first is to style a profile page (profile-styling.html) to match the design that is provided

##### Requirements

- Match the final design as closely as possible (see `profile-styling-finished.png` 
for what it should look like)
- Add hover effects to the navigation in the the header and footer.
- Use only html and css
- Specific styles can be found in the `html` file.
- Images used are provided in the `images` directory
- Write vanilla css within `style` tags in the `head`
- Use any css or html that works in Chrome 65 + (no other browsers will be tested )
- It will be evaluated on a 15" Macbook Pro on Chrome
- Style only a Desktop version
- Create a "sticky footer" so regardless of the content, the footer is stuck to the 
  bottom of the content

## Part 2

Answer one or both of the javascript questions. (see the `javascript-questions` directory).
All of the info on how to answer the questions can be found within the `question.js` file
